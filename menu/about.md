慢速中文 Slow Chinese is a cultural podcast for Chinese learners. If you are learning Chinese and are curious about China, you’ve come to the right place! They are personal narratives by native Chinese people, they are read in Mandarin at a slow speed (2~3 characters per second). Topics vary from language, knowledge, tradition and culture to opinions on social phenomena.

We are a team of enthusiastic people and are devoted ourselves to revealing the authentic China in its own language. However, we are not professional Chinese teachers. We do not guarantee the correctness of word choice or grammar. But we do guarantee that we are 100% Chinese.
